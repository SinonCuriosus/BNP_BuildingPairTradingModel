# BNP_BuildingPairTradingModel

## üìå Business Case  
**Objective:** Build a Pair Trading Model to identify and exploit pricing dislocations between two correlated stocks.  

**Strategy:**  
- Long one stock and short the other based on **daily close prices**.  
- **Time horizon:** Medium to long term (1 week to 1 month).

## 2/3. Data Collection and preprocessing
- **Source:** yfinance lib
- **Stocks to consider:**
    [
        "ASML.AS", "BESI.AS", "IFX.DE", "HSBA.L", 
        "INGA.AS", "ISP.MI", "ABI.BR", "RI.PA", 
        "BN.PA", "TSCO.L"
    ]

### Features added (thinking used)
- **RSI**

    RSI > 60 => a strong buy momentum is ongoing

    RSI < 40 => a strong sell momentum is ongoing

- **EMA**

    Price > EMA Long && Price > EMA Short => Price might be good for selling

    Price < EMA Long && Price < EMA Short => Price might be good for buying

    **EMA was choosen agains't SMA** because it reacts faster to current changes.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions  

- **Challenges found in this phase:**  
  Missing daily close prices for some tickers ‚Üí prevents normalized comparisons.  

- **Solution implemented:**  
  Forward-fill missing dates with the most recent available close price, creating a **continuous daily price series**.

**Why did I use these 3 indicators and not other ones?**
1. Net Income growth analysis and Share Repurchases influence highly the potencial price of share, respectively, because:
    - If the net income increases, naturally the price of the shares also increase if the they are not overvalued
    - If a company repurchases stocks it reduces their supply to the market. Therefore if the demand remains steady or increases the stock naturally will increase on price

2. Long-Term debt
    - The first, second, and third rule in investing is to never lose money.
    - We must remain mindful of macroeconomic scenarios that could push businesses toward bankruptcy. 
    - Bankruptcy often stems from a company‚Äôs inability to service its debt. If a company can repay its debt using its net earnings within 2-4 years (there's no fixed number here, but it should be a small number ofc), that is generally a reasonable timeframe, as it allows them to better navigate periods of macroeconomic uncertainty.

  **Note:**
  We could and should do a lot more analysis in the missing fundamental variables but I guess **this already shows up some analytical skills given Fundamental Analysis** which is not asked in the assessment but if I could choose I'd partially integrate it in the work as it has analytical value.



## 4. Statistical Analysis
- Measures used:
    1. Engle‚ÄìGranger cointegration p-value:

        In pairs trading, we want pairs that move together in the long run so that their spread is mean-reverting. Therefore we want this value to be the lowest possible to reject no cointegration.


    2.  Alpha e Beta:
        \[
        \beta = \frac{\mathrm{Cov}(P_a, P_b)}{\mathrm{Var}(P_b)}, \quad
        \alpha = \bar{P_a} - \beta \bar{P_b}
        \]
        Example of each:
        If Beta = 1.5 => historically, when P_b moves 1‚Ç¨, P_a moves 1.50‚Ç¨ in the same direction.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions  

- **Challenges found in this phase:** 

1. THe pair trading aims to do Heding acheiving a kind of "market neutral" status. If the Beta is not considered to be stable it's useless because might still be exposed to market direction or sector trends.

2. Strangely I was expecting to get a stocks from the same industry correlated... But instead the pair of stocks which scored the biggest value were ASML which is from the Semiconductors industry and Danone (Package Foods).
- **Solution implemented:**  
  I've built 2 models with different enterprises. T

1. The rationale was: Although I have got the beta unstable...
  Let's follow the assessment request and give a trial with the stocks which correlated the best P_value = 0.031822.
  After finetunning the model with EMA + RSI it gave:

    2024-01-04 | BUY           ASML.AS at 636.15

    2024-01-04 | SELL SHORT    BN.PA at 56.80

    With a return 47% (excluding taxes and transaction costs)

2. The second trial which I though we should give a trial were for 2 companies which happened of being the same sector + had the best fundamental to avoid us loosing all our money which is: goind bankrupt, because both were able to pay all it's debt in equal or less than 3 years.

    The companies were: ASML.AS and BESI.AS and the analysis are above in the **Fundamentals brief summary 2021-2024** part.

    The results were:

    2024-01-04 | BUY           ASML.AS at 636.15

    2024-01-04 | BUY           BESI.AS at 122.3

    With a return 65% (excluding taxes and transaction costs)


## 5. Trading Strategy
### Risk Management
#### Risk Management
- Entry Signal:

1. Long

Asumming the 3 companies have stable financials although solely 1 showed to be strong in strong in earnings (ASML.SA vs BESI.SA and BN.PA), we have used 2 EMA curves. One to analyse monthly stock behavior and other to analyse weekly stock behavior.

Given the first phrase we assumed that we solely assumed **potencial entry points** in a stock once it's Price < EMA_short AND Price < EMA_long.
They would be **effective entry points** if the RSI would detect an oversold condition of those stocks bellow 30 within the last 40 days.

2. Short

price > EMA_long AND price > EMA_short AND RSI > 50
Would consider the stock as overbought and would short it. 

**NOTE**
I do not like to short because:
1. It potentially and theoretically may bring infinite losses.
2. THe gains are theoretically limited to the price of the stock.

- Exit Signals:



2. How much would you invest in each pair?

I'd use the Hedge Ratio, e.g.:
If I had 10 000‚Ç¨ to invest(purely in stocks, assuming we have already optimized the missing money in Treasury Bonds) and assuming a Beta calculated in the statistics of 1.5 (when B moves 1‚Ç¨, A moves 1.5‚Ç¨ in the same direction), I'd go long to A for instance instance with 4000‚Ç¨ given the beta value B=1.5 * 4000‚Ç¨ = 6000‚Ç¨, having the total 10000‚Ç¨ invested. 

We do this to avoid overexposing ourselves to a sole stock, therefore we invest accordint to the Beta Value multiplication over the second stock from the pair given the volatility of both not being the same.
